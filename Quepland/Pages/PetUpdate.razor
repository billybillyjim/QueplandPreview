<p>With pets now in the game, Quepland has its first in-app purchases included with the update. I realize microtransactions are a very contentious issue, so I thought it might be good to explain my view on them here.</p>


<p>I spent a good amount of time thinking about what kind of monetization I wanted to add to Quepland. While leaving everything completely free would be nice, 
    I currently would be making more money working a part time minimum wage job one day a week than what I'm earning with Quepland.
    I really like the way the game is turning out and I would love to continue to develop it for a long time, but with the
    way things are going I am going to have to start working on other projects. With that in mind, I am adding some small microtransactions to the game
    to see if it is a viable source of income, or if I need to make multiple games in order to get by on Kongregate.</p>

<p>The structure of Quepland made me shy away from items or boosts that increase gathering speed or the like. I find microtransactions that make the game
    shorter in that way to be counterproductive. The game becomes less fun for the purchaser more quickly, and the creator keeps their paying player base for
    a shorter amount of time. Nothing in Quepland really lent itself well to paid items, so I decided to add a new feature that would work better with them.</p>

<p>Pets are creatures that follow the player around and earn experience just like players do, at one-tenth the rate. For every level a pet has gained in a stat, the player
    gains bonus experience when training that stat. Every pet has an affinity, which is a stat that they gain experience for more quickly in, and help players gain more
    experience more quickly in return. In addition to affinities, pets also have a specialization role, which is based on the average of their combat, gathering, and crafting stats. The
    highest of those three groups also gets a boost.</p>

<p>Right now, pets are mainly an experience gaining mechanism, but I have a lot of ideas for them in the future, including pet competitions and tasks similar to slayer tasks in Runescape.
    They also serve the purpose of making it more possible to attain levels greater than 100, which Construction and Magic will also help with. </p>

<p>So these are pets. I realize this is a ton of text, but I figure if a few people read it the information can disseminate to the less interested players.</p>
