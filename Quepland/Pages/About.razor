<h1>About</h1>

<p><b>What is Quepland?</b></p>
<p>Quepland is a game I made to learn Blazor, a relatively new framework that lets developers code websites using C# instead of Javascript.</p>

<p><b>What is the future for Quepland?</b></p>
<p>Quepland is basically in a beta stage. Everything is working like it should and there aren't many bugs, but there is a lot more I would love to do with the game.</p>

<p><b>Credits</b></p>
<p>All of the item icons in this game were pulled from a set made by Lorc. You can find more by him by googling Lorc Icons.</p>
